# Korg MS-X

An extreme MONOTRON mod by Soul Machine in form of an SMD PCB.


## Roots

The schematics design and build instructions were published by Soul Machine on his project page
[Far Beyond Perception Instruments](https://www.djsoulmachine.com/farbeyondperception/msx.html)
and as 
[PDF here](http://www.djsoulmachine.com/farbeyondperception/msx/MSX-schematics.pdf).

He built it with a lot of perf board and freehand wiring.


## Where this project takes over

This project aims to take that design and develop a neat printed circuit board with SMD components where sensible so that it can be produced and to a large degree even be assembled by cheap manufacturers like [JLCPCB](jlcpcb.com) or [PCBWay](pcbway.com).
